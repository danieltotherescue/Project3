###Technologies used:
HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Google Maps API, Google OAuth, forecast.io API, Facebook comments, ATOM, Github.

###General Approach:
There are so many road trip apps out there, but none of them seem to tell you what the weather is gonna be like when you arrive at your destination. Our goal with this project was to square the circle and allow users to rest easy, knowing that the weather forecast would be available to them. As a bonus, users can access their past searches and remember the good times that they had on the road.

###Trello Board:

###Document our app's RESTful API:
Roadtrippr will log all of your searches, which a signed-in user can view, update or delete entirely.

###Unsolved Problems:
1: The weather at destination at time of arrival

2: More midpoints (midpoint of midpoints)

3: A link to view the map of the modified or saved searches from the saved searches page

###Major hurdles:
Early-on git workflow.
